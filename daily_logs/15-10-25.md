-> First i get the grip of whats going on workflow,workFlowSteps,workflowExecution,TaskExecution
->1.workflow has steps ,step has foreign key workflow.
  2.workflow has workflowexecutions too, workflowexecutions has workflow as foriehnkey
  3.step has TaskExecution , TaskExecution has step has foringn key
  4.step has dependents step ->self forien key(this will help us in weater to eecute a step or not) step may be dependent on one or more steps
  5.taskexecution(part of receipe cooking) and wrokflow(recepie cooking)
  6.taskexecution has input data they are like place holders {"phone": "{{patient_phone}}"}

-> then  Celery Integration & Distributed Task Execution
   first create flowpiolet/celery.py
   this will create and links to use django settings

   then loading celety app in init.py

   then in setting the celery appconfiguarations 

   You can start multiple Celery workers (like multiple “kitchens”).

Each can run N concurrent tasks → total parallel capacity = workers × concurrency.
