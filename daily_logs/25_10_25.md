Goal create a HomePage -> two buttons Explore Workflow and create wotkflows 
and then navigate through them.

->how to make diff pages in react and how to nagigate throgh
->how css styles works.


## npm install react-router-dom 

this has to go in main.jsx import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

so there are 2 important compomnents of routing Routes,Router,

<Routes>
    <Route/> -> has path and element attribute
    <Route/>
</Routes>


Goal is to use the /api/workflows/ in ExploreWokflow Page

here i used async function to fect the list of dictionraus fro. /api/workflows/

and then i rendered the list using {workflow.map()} , we can't we for loop because it doent return jsx

{workflows.map((workflow,ind) => (
    <button></button>
)
)}
