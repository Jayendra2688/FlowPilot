1..Environment varibles
-> (Key-value) pairs provided by the OS has.our programs can use it.
-> usually we store our SECRET_KEYS  of apps in Environment varibales
2.usage[Manual ]
-> export DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
-> import os , os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
3.better process [No need to use export]
-> from dotenv import load_dotenv
    import os
    load_dotenv()
    os.getenv('')


2..related_names
there is workflow obj and we link it another model as 
step = models.ForeignKey(
          Workflow,
          on_delete=models.CASCADE,
          related_name='steps'
      ) 
-> model.step ->gives workflow obj
->"related_names" this create backworks relationship we can get all steps workflow.steps.all() -> gives all models (here 'workflow' is obj)

3..auto_add_now (one time ->first created at) auto_add(everytime object saves)
