I leanered how to intergrate react frontedn with django app

Divided Django apps and project folder into backend forlder and react app in new folder

How they connected -> react calls django apis thats it

but to make them happen we must add crosheaders in project folder

so basically we run the react server by -> npm run dev

and react server starts and then it calls django api and renders

so in dajngo we are using APIView
