  üî• Production Issue #1: No Execution State Tracking

  Your Current Approach:
  # Workflow stored as JSON
  workflow_json = {
      "steps": [
          {"type": "send_otp", "config": {"phone": "+91123"}},
          {"type": "create_patient", "config": {"name": "John"}},
          {"type": "send_success", "config": {"message": "Done!"}}
      ]
  }

  # Execute sequentially
  for step in steps:
      execute_step(step)  # ‚ùå What if this crashes?

  Real Production Scenario:
  - 11:30 AM: 500 patients sign up simultaneously
  - 11:32 AM: Step 2 (create_patient) fails for 200 patients because database is overloaded
  - 11:33 AM: Your server crashes due to memory issues

  Questions:
  1. Which 200 patients failed?
  2. Which patients completed successfully?
  3. Do you retry all 500 or just the 200 that failed?
  4. How do you prevent duplicate OTPs being sent during retry?

  With your current system: You have no idea. You'd have to restart all 500 workflows.

  üî• Production Issue #2: No Concurrency Control

  Example:
  # Patient A and Patient B sign up at the same time
  # Both workflows try to create patient records simultaneously

  # Workflow A: send_otp(+91123) -> create_patient("John", id=100)
  # Workflow B: send_otp(+91456) -> create_patient("Jane", id=100)  # Same ID!

  Problems:
  - Race conditions in database
  - Resource conflicts (same phone number, same email)
  - No way to limit concurrent executions

  üî• Production Issue #3: No Partial Failure Recovery

  Real Example:
  # 3-step workflow: OTP -> Create Patient -> Send Welcome Email
  # Step 1: ‚úÖ OTP sent successfully
  # Step 2: ‚úÖ Patient created in database  
  # Step 3: ‚ùå Email service is down (SendGrid API failure)

  Your current system response: "Task failed at step 3"

  Problems:
  1. User already received OTP and is created in DB
  2. If you retry the whole workflow, you'll:
    - Send duplicate OTP
    - Try to create duplicate patient (DB error)
    - Confuse the user

  What production systems do: Retry only step 3, keep steps 1-2 results.

  üî• Production Issue #4: No Observability

  Business asks: "Why are 30% of patient registrations failing?"

  Your current system: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è "Check the logs somewhere..."

  What you need:
  - Which step fails most often?
  - Average execution time per step?
  - Which workflows are currently running?
  - Alert when failure rate > 10%

  üî• Production Issue #5: No Async Execution

  Current problem:
  def patient_signup(request):
      # This blocks the web server for 30+ seconds
      execute_workflow(workflow_json)  # Send OTP (5s) + Create patient (10s) + Send email (15s)
      return Response("Success")

  Result: Your Django server can handle only ~3 requests simultaneously instead of 1000+.

  üî• Production Issue #6: No Complex Dependencies

  Real workflow example:
  Send OTP ‚Üí Verify OTP ‚Üí Create Patient
      ‚Üì           ‚Üì            ‚Üì
  Send Welcome ‚Üí Update CRM ‚Üí Send Slack Alert

  Your current JSON approach: Can only handle sequential steps, not parallel or conditional ones.

  üí° The Solution Architecture

  This is why we need:

  1. WorkflowExecution Model: Track each run independently
  2. TaskExecution Model: Track each step's state
  3. Celery/Redis: Async execution with retry logic
  4. State Machine: Handle partial failures gracefully

  Example of what we'll build:
  # When workflow starts
  execution = WorkflowExecution.objects.create(
      workflow=workflow,
      status='running',
      started_at=now()
  )

  # Each step creates a task record
  task1 = TaskExecution.objects.create(
      execution=execution,
      step=send_otp_step,
      status='completed',  # ‚úÖ This succeeded
      result={'otp_sent': True}
  )

  task2 = TaskExecution.objects.create(
      execution=execution,
      step=create_patient_step,
      status='failed',     # ‚ùå This failed
      error='Database timeout'
  )

  # Now you can:
  # 1. Retry only the failed step
  # 2. See exactly what failed and why
  # 3. Resume from step 2 without re-doing step 1

  Key insight: We separate what to do (Workflow) from what happened (WorkflowExecution + TaskExecution).

  Does this make sense? This is exactly how systems like Airflow, Temporal, and AWS Step Functions work under the hood.
